# Documentation of work

- 10:00 started assignment; now considering frameworks and needed algorithms
- 10:15 decided on using warp, serde, log, tokio
- 10:45 completed writing basic structure of program. Now getting myself tea, a piece of paper and work out the algorithm.

- 12:00 create first implementation of O(1) algorithm.
          A much, much simpler O(nÂ²) algorithm exists, though as I can't ask about requirements, I decided to pretend I was told that n is usally very, very big. I am not sure if people taking thousands of flights a day makes sense, but here we are.

- 12:21 have first passing test. Thinking about cheap optimisations

- 12:26 got rid of all String cloning, by using references in implementation of algorithm.

- 12:34 implement more test cases
